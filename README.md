# 2D Game Engine Mechanics

An attempt to implement 2D engine game mechanics from scratch (physics and collisions).

Currently, there's only a basic implementation of circular object collisions.

## How to run

Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the simulation:

```bash
python ./circle_circle_collisions/flick_mechanism_sim.py
```

You can hold the left click on a circle and drag it around, or you can hold the right click on a circle, drag your mouse away from the circle, and release the right click. This will flick the circle.
